##**Summary:** 
This project was created for a Final Project while I was taking  "Web Scripting with PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) (CIS166AE)" at Scottsdale Community College. 

##**Scope:** 
This project was conceived and designed to showcase a variety of code learned and practiced during the course including: 
- Creating and using variables
- Creating and managing global elements such as POST data
- Using include to organize code snippets and functions in separate files
- Using PHP to display HTML elements on the page
- Creating and interacting with a MySQL database using PDO objects
- Conditional logic and basic object constructs
- Debugging and testing the application. 

##**Demo Installation:** 
You can access the live demo for Family Web at the following address: 

[Family Web Live Demo](http://crisromero.com/live-demos/familyweb/)

You can login using the sample credentials used below. The admin account has full access to manage data and users, so please do not delete or modify these two sample accounts. I will try to implement a reset button which would drop all table entries except the demo info at a later date. 

**Demo Logins:**

**Admin Login Credential**

##**License:** 
Portions of the code to construct this project were created or edited during the CIS166AE Course and all code was modified to suit the application - therefore I am licensing this application as open-source withh attribution. (More specifics on this as soon as I research the subject.)
